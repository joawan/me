                        Following the success of SPiD, and the required transformation of Schibsted to meet new user needs,
                        Schibsted Payment became part of the new organisation

                        I continued as <em>Lead Developer</em> of the SPiD platform, improving testing, setting up <strong>CI/CD</strong> pipelines and processes,
                        automating infrastructure, splitting up the platform into <strong>microservices</strong> and doing <strong>cost optimisations</strong> in AWS.

                      Working as a <em>Full Stack Developer</em> with broad responsibilities and cross team collaboration projects I quickly became <strong>Staff Software Engineer</strong> within Schibsted's new structure.
                      As a Staff Software Engineer and expert in Schibsted end user IAM solution, now renamed <strong>Schibsted account</strong>, focus shifted into collaborating with other teams and designing solutions for integrations with services like Privacy, Payment and Subscription services as well as Data platforms.

                        At <a href="https://www.schibstedpayment.no/">Schibsted Payment</a> I grew into the <em>Full Stack Developer</em> I am today.
                        I started leading the <strong>front end development</strong> and <strong>UX</strong>,
                        while also doing backend <strong>PHP</strong> development for the SPiD platform.
                        I eventually introduced and took on <strong>node.js</strong> development and a <strong>DevOps</strong> role.
                        As the SPiD platform grew from 0 to over 6 million users, with clients as
                        <a href="http://www.aftonbladet.se/">Aftonbladet.se</a>, <a href="http://www.vg.no/">VG.no</a>,

                        so did my responsibilities grow. I ended up as <strong>Tech Lead and Lead Developer</strong> for the platform,
                        pushing the move of the entire platform to <strong>AWS</strong>, and doing <strong>project management</strong>
                        of integration projects as well as internal development projects.

                        the integration of SPiD, but it became clear my expertise was needed for the development of the SPiD platform instead,
                        which led to Schibsted Payment taking me in as a consultant until they hired me away.
